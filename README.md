# DL-Based-Illumination-correction
Deep Learning Based Illumination correction For Dermatological Macro images
# Illumination Correction using UNA Model

This repository provides the code and pre-trained model for performing **illumination correction** in images using a **UNA (U-Net with Attention)** architecture. This model is designed to enhance poorly lit or unevenly illuminated images, making them clearer and more visually appealing.

## ðŸš€ Features

- U-Net-based architecture with attention mechanisms
- Pretrained model for instant testing
- Simple and modular codebase (fine-tuned and final output )
- Can be applied to various low-light image datasets

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

The UNA model combines the strengths of:
- **U-Net**: for semantic image-to-image translation
- **Attention Mechanism**: to focus on important spatial regions

This allows the model to correct the uneven illumination present in the dermatological macro images and produce even illumination.
